## Developpement Usage
this should run on the galles.io dev server
however it can be runned locally, with a `node . ` command in the root folder of the server
## User Management
Our user model is the `Person` model.
To create a new user make an https post request to `/people`
The body should at least contain an email and a password. (password hashing is done server side no worries).
To login a make a post request to `/people/login` containing the email and the password.
On success the request will contain `id:***************` where the star are the acces token.
Any authenticated request must contain the accesstoken to be allowed. Such as `/people/1` to query a user profile .
